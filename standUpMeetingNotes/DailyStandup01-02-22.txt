Successfully got in contact with Justin Boomer (client) and have joined the discord for communication.

We have weighted each of the current user stories.

Successfully looked through GitLab together and added/made relevant changes to the git board

Use Python and BeautifulSoup to do web scraping

We will use Mapplotlib (open-source library) in order to visualise the scraped data on to graphs following our user stories 

For the video call for the 9th, get in a teams call and one person record screen and run through our program, everyone will try and say something in the recording if possible.

Branch on git for each feature we are working on this split and make personal branches if needed. Merge to the main when done.

Started working on the code for extracting the data from the job listing websites. Main points of focus are the job title, location of the job, desired languages required for the 
job. Then iterate through every relevant page and gamedev job listed on the website.

For this week and Wednesday lab, for the end of sprint 1, the main focus is working prototype by scraping data from only aswift.com and displaying this data in a heatmap 
using Mapplotlib. Make sure that the data is formatted in a way so we can use it for graphs.
