Group 17 meeting notes 22/02/2022

Attendance: Ricky (rr270), Mustafa (mb842), Callum (cr330), Anas (am1205), Mark (mt418) and via telephone Sam (st500)

Scrum master is Callum

Group members meet to discuss progress on user stories in light of the impending sprint deadline.

None of the user stories have yet been completed: the heatmap and job title string search need to be integrated, and the job language requirements search needs to be completed so that it filters properly and not with string matching (which is insufficient to meet the requirements of the user story).

Callum aims to complete the job language requirements search by the end of the day.

Riccardo and Anas agree to work on integrating the heatmap.

Callum successfully manages to integrate the job title string search during the meeting, completing that user story.
