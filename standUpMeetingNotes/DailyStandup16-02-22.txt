Group 17 meeting notes 16/02/2022

Attendance: Ricky (rr270), Mustafa (mb842), Callum (cr330)
Scrum master is Callum standing in for Anas who couldn't make it

Ricky reports he has found a method that could make it possible to create a heatmap visualisation by looking up the physical coordinates of cities from their names. He is currently working on this.

Mustafa reports he has found a method to get the programming languages mentioned in job descriptions out of the descriptions. He has pushed this to his branch in source control. He will later work on a way to get this data into the CSV file.

Callum regrets not having worked on any user stories this week, but they report having updated the README with installation instructions.
